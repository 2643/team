* Problems
	* Team is mid-range
	* Hard to get sponsors
	* Hard to get recognition

* Solution
	* These are just ideas
	* Add webcam to robot
		* Add a HUD on the computer
		* Add an animation showing where it is going to go
		* Show battery life
		* Add power-save mode
	* Improve driving
		* Experiment with different control systems	
		* Add ramp up and coast down for controls
		* Check if drivers need a different control system
		* See if they want any prescripted actions
		* Check if tey want control system
	* Vision
		* Machine learning or 
		* Stereo for depthmap
		* Needs to be glorious
		* Auto needs to be super simple

* Slides from 2056
   * Sets goals for everything
      * Start big, work your way down
      * “Focus on the little things, and the big things take care of themselves.”
   * Build season official meetings:
      * 30 Official hours weekly 
      * Behind the scenes, additional 20+ hours
   * Competition season schedule
      * Practices everyday 
      * Lunch time - half hour
      * After school - half hour to 2 hours
      * Designs - revisions as needed
      * Bag day to saturday champs
      * NEED PRACTICE ROBOT
         * Identical to robot
         * Find a schedule that works for your team 
   * Decision making
      * Make decisions early!
      * Heavily CAD Driven
      * Rely on experience
      * Learn from other (CD, RI3D, Build Blitz) 
         * Copy as much from other teams 
      * Consensus vs voting
         * Consensus works better especially in bigger teams
      * Know your limits. Design with them. 
      * Don’t do everything! 
         * Quality vs Quantity
   * Design methodology
      * Simple
      * Robust
      * Fewer parts, less design time, less fabrication time, less things to go wrong
      * Avoid doing everything! 
      * Design according to resources
      * Buy everything you can 
      * CAD everything; or not (remember your resources)
            * Better to cad everything
* Case studies
   * 2056 - 2012 season
      * Skipped:
         * Vision
            * Key shot aimed by lining up robot between hoop and driver
               * 90% accuracy rate without vision  
         * Special feature for barrier
   * 2056 - 2016 season 
      * What 2056 did
         * Non-turreted shooter
            * Aimed by vision from 2012
         * Telescoping hang
         * Single mechanism to intake and handle defenses
         * Skipped: 
            * Intake opposite shooter
            * Turret
            * Shot was partially blockable
   * 2056 - 2017 season 
      * All elite teams wanted:
         * Floor gear intake
         * Turreted shooter
         * Fancy ball funneling
      * What 2056 did
         * Roller intake for balls 
         * Shooter based on 2012/2016
            * Reused 2012/2016 vision code
         * Human load gears
         * Skipped:
            * Turret 
            * Floor load gears
            * Fancy indexing
         *  Always aimed for boiler from the same spot on the field
* Suggestions
* Maybe we should start making subsystems prototypes during off season?
* Have drivetrain with wiring built and done by first week
   * We need to move faster 
* ALWAYS STICK TO SCHEDULE
   * Even if you need to drop mechanisms
